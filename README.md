# Velvet brows

Modern beauty salons provide a very large list of services, ranging from manicure, ending with a complex of rejuvenating procedures. Our salon “Velvet Eyebrows” is trying to keep up with the market, so administrators need to be able to manage services so that customers can view the entire list while waiting for a specialist in the client area.
You will have to develop a subsystem for working with our company's services, which should include the following functionality:
• viewing the list of services,
• adding/deleting/editing service data,
• work with additional images for services,
• client registration for the service,
• manage the nearest appointments for beauty salon services.

These instructions will provide you with a copy of the project and help you run it on your local computer for development and testing.
